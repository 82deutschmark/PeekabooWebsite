# PeekabooWebsite

## Project Overview

PeekabooWebsite is an interactive educational platform built with a modern TypeScript/React front-end (Vite + Tailwind CSS) and a Node.js server using Drizzle for database interactions. It prioritizes privacy (see llms.txt and privacy policy) and provides rich content for users.

## Key Components

- **Client**: `client/src` contains React pages (`home.tsx`, `privacy.tsx`, etc.)
- **Server**: `server/` hosts API endpoints and database logic
- **Shared**: `shared/` holds common utilities
- **Configurations**: Vite (`vite.config.ts`), Tailwind (`tailwind.config.ts`), Drizzle (`drizzle.config.ts`)
- **Docs**: `docs/changelog.md` tracks project history; `llms.txt` for LLM accessibility

## Installation & Development

1. Ensure Node.js (>=16) and npm are installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Access site at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Next Steps

1. Resolve import errors (`next/link`) and confirm routing setup.
2. Implement and document server API endpoints for dynamic content.
3. Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows.
4. Enhance LLM accessibility: update llms.txt and improve metadata.
5. Plan production deployment and CI/CD pipeline.
